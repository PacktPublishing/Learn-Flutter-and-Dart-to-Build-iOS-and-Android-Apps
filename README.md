## About the Video Course
You don't need to learn Android/ Java and iOS/ Swift to build real native mobile apps! Flutter—a framework developed by Google—allows you to learn one language (Dart) and build beautiful native mobile apps in no time. Flutter is a SDK that provides the tooling to compile Dart code into native code, and it also gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled UI elements (so called widgets) you can use to compose your user interfaces. Flutter is trending, and gets used for major Google apps such as Adwords. It's now marked as "ready for production" so now is the time to jump in and learn it! 
This course will teach you Flutter and Dart from scratch. With Flutter, you'll be able to write code only once and ship your apps both to the Apple AppStore and Google Play. Use Google's Material Design to build beautiful yet fully customizable apps in no time with almost zero effort. You can use the rich widget suite Flutter provides to add common UI elements such as buttons, switches, forms, toolbars, lists, and more—or simply build your own widgets—Flutter makes that a breeze too. You're interested in building real native mobile apps for the two most popular mobile platforms - iOS and Android. You want to explore the full set of features Flutter offers. Don't want to spend hours learning two completely different languages

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is for beginners and experienced developers who are interested in diving into mobile app development using one language for both platforms. It’s also ideal for experienced iOS or Android developers who want to build cross-platform (iOS + Android) apps with one single programming language. No prior knowledge of either is required! You certainly don't need any Android or iOS development experience either, since the whole idea behind Flutter is to only learn one language.
